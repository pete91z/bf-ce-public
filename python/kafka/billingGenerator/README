Billing generator writes avro data to a kafka topic called billing.

This is slimmed down version of a script I used for generating random billing data, it omits the contact map field originally in the avro schema. Thus it may or may not error
when executed as I have not re-tested without these changes. Please let me know if you encounter any issues.
